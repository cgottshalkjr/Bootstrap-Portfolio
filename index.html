                    <p class="text-light text-left">I was born on the 27th of September in the year of our Lord 1985.
                        The
                        weather was dark
                        and foreboding. A mighty hurricane had come crashing down on the fair city of Camden,
                        New Jersey. Hurricane Gloria. My mother said if I were to be a maiden I would take on
                        the name of the mighty Hurricane that brashed at the walls of the hospital. Thank the
                        heavens I was an ugly baby boy. My mother said if I were to be a maiden I would take on
                        the name of the mighty Hurricane that brashed at the walls of the hospital. Thank the

                        heavens I was an ugly baby boy. </p>
                    <p class="text-light">Actually, nothing dark or foreboding came to fruition from that damned
                        day. I grew into a
                        normal young boy with simple aspirations. To one day be the greatest boxer the world had
                        ever known. Well, that didn't happen. In fact I never stepped inside of a ring. :| All
                        that malarky aside, I'm just a simple gentleman. I enjoy Boxing, am a Film nerd, and
                        like to cook my tush off. Sichuan food is prob my fave. I've even read a book. If you
                        want to get wrecked in Dominoes, get at me! If you want to go milling about in a
                        different country, let's do it. Want to build something out of wood after watching a
                        youtube video, what up?! Chopping wood, yep, I'm down. I'll fell a tree with the best of
                        them!</p>
                    <p class="text-light">All in all, at this very moment, I am beginning this paragraph in
                        deceit. I wish to tell you nothing more, at least not right now. But I want to put more
                        text on the page. I am not sure the amount I originally had filled it out enough to make
                        it look nice wrapping around the photo. So here I am making you read these words. Ya
                        know, I will be embarrassed if I write all this out and still recieve a bad grade on
                        this project. I before E accept after C. *receive... Dang, I mean except.</p>
