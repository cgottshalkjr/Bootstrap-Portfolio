                            <p class="text-light">I was born on the 27th of September in the year of our Lord 1985. The
                                weather was dark
                                and foreboding. A mighty hurricane had come crashing down on the fair city of Camden,
                                New Jersey. Hurricane Gloria. My mother said if I were to be a maiden I would take on
                                the name of the mighty Hurricane that brashed at the walls of the hospital. Thank the
                                heavens I was an ugly baby boy.</p>
                            <p>Actually, nothing dark or foreboding came to fruition from that damned day. I grew into a
                                normal young boy with simple aspirations. To one day be the greatest boxer the world had
                                ever known. Well, that didn't happen. In fact I never stepped inside of a ring. :| All
                                that malarky aside, I'm just a simple gentleman. I enjoy Boxing, am a Film nerd, and
                                like to cook my tush off. Sichuan food is prob my fave. I've even read a book. If you
                                want to get wrecked in Dominoes, get at me! If you want to go milling about in a
                                different country, let's do it. Want to build something out of wood after watching a
                                youtube video, what up?! Chopping wood, yep, I'm down. I'll fell a tree with the best of
                                them!</p>
