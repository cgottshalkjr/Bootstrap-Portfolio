                                and foreboding. A mighty hurricane had come crashing down on the fair city of Camden,
                                New Jersey. Hurricane Gloria. My mother said if I were to be a maiden I would take on

                                normal young boy with simple aspirations. To one day be the greatest boxer the world had
                                ever known. Well, that didn't happen. In fact I never stepped inside of a ring. :| All
                                that malarky aside, I'm just a simple gentleman. I enjoy Boxing, am a Film nerd, and
                                like to cook my tush off. Sichuan food is prob my fave. I've even read a book. If you
