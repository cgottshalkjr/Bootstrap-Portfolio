# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This project was my first Bootstrap Page that I created. It is a temporary portfolio, until I get a chanace to update it and make it more to how I would like it. 
This was also the first time I used Bootstrap. I used different elements, instead of going with a themed site.
The NavBar proved tricky at first as I tried to us rows and cols, but did not work the way I wanted it to. So I added a little javascript built into Bootstrap to make the links shrink down in a hamburger nav icon and then drop down from there.
I elected to use the Jumbotron to put all of my main content.
The one thing that ended up not coming out 100% the way it should have been was the portfolio page. I had trouble with the spacing with the cards. It's not as smooth as maybe it should be when shrinking down to a smaller screen size. It does however still stack vertically when down to a small screen size.
I also added a sticky footer at the bottom of every page.
This being the first time I used Bootstrap I could have defintely done things better. I will get better at using it next time around when I am able to make a site for my real portfolio.
